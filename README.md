_Note: this project was originally published on the Asset Store, but it is no longer maintained. It supports Unity3D up to version 5.5_

_TBC Sprite Importer_ is a tool for Unity I developed to keep 2D Sprites and UI elements organized during the import phase.

You can find detailed information [on my website](http://www.marcosecchi.it/tools/tbc-sprite-importer/?lang=en).
